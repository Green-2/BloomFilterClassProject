//TODO.


## Specifications 
This project is fully written with Java and maven as project manager. However, I don't recommend launching the project with maven, as 
I have not thought it to work that way.

## How to run the project 
Use your favorite development interface and start the main function in the Main class.
This will launch the Benchmarks. Be aware that this will take some time, expect it to take 3 minutes or more.
